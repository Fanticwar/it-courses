#this program is like chicken:

#chicken does input (seed)
print("elo, what is your personal identification string? ")
name = input()

#chicken does output (egg)
print("elo "+name+".")
print("your name length is "+str(len(name))+".")

#chicken gets to do input again (more seed)
print("how many years have you been alive?")
age = input()

#chicken gets to do output again (more egg)
print("in 1 year you will be "+str(int(age)+1)+" years old")
